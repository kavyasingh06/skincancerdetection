Skin Cancer Detection using Deep Learning
Project Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-powered system to detect skin cancer from images. The model classifies skin lesions into benign and malignant categories, helping in early diagnosis and prevention. The project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.

Features

Upload an image of a skin lesion and classify it as benign or malignant.

Batch prediction support for multiple images.

Visualize training performance using accuracy and loss plots.

Confusion matrix to evaluate model predictions.
